**Note**: For a more comprehensive history of labor activism at Miami, check out this [story in the Miami Student.](https://www.miamistudent.net/article/2022/02/a-history-of-labor-activism-at-miami)

## 2014

**Fall 2014**: A group of faculty on the Regional campuses met over beers and french fries with leadership from the Ohio Conference of the AAUP. The faculty were worried by top-down decisions to transform the Regionals. A couple of professors from Oxford who shared their concerns drove down to join the meeting.

Around the same time, Karen Dawisha and Matthew Gordon emailed a list of full professors in Oxford, inviting them to meet to discuss concerns about recent decision-making by Miami leadership. The Oxford professors filled a history department meeting room in Upham to bursting and the meeting lasted nearly two hours.

## 2015

**April 2015**: Miami’s AAUP advocacy chapter [formally launches](https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/miami-professors-form-advocacy-group/MiUFJCJTiJ6JAMAq2RdORJ/) with the support of roughly 100 faculty. The launch featured a speech by now-former AAUP National President Rudy Fichtenbaum, who spoke to a crowd of about 200 people. [Karen Dawisha](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/obituaries/karen-dawisha-68-dies-traced-roots-of-russian-corruption.html), professor of political science, and [Keith Tuma](https://www.miamioh.edu/cas/academics/departments/english/about/faculty_staff/faculty-alphabetical/tuma-keith/index.html), professor of English, served as the first co-presidents of the chapter.

[University Senate votes](https://www.miamistudent.net/article/2015/11/restructuring-to-bring-six-new-departments-to-regional-campuses) to restructure Miami’s regional campuses. Miami’s AAUP chapter launched too late to have much impact on the transformation of the Regionals, but quickly turned to other issues.
